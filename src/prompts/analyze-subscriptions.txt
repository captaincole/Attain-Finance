SUBSCRIPTION ANALYSIS TASK

You have been provided with a CSV file containing credit card transactions. Your task is to analyze this data and identify all recurring subscriptions.

STEP 1: RETRIEVE THE DATA FILES
Use MCP resources to fetch the files. The resources will return the complete file contents:

1. MCP Resource URI: pfinance://data/transactions.csv
   - Resource name: transactions-csv
   - Contains: date, description, amount, category
   - 3 months of transaction history
   - IMPORTANT: Save this to a local file (e.g., transactions.csv) before processing

2. MCP Resource URI: pfinance://scripts/analyze-subscriptions.js
   - Resource name: analysis-script
   - Optional Node.js script for precise subscription detection
   - IMPORTANT: Save this to a local file (e.g., analyze-subscriptions.js) before running
   - Make the file executable if needed
   - Run with: node analyze-subscriptions.js transactions.csv
   - Outputs detailed subscription analysis with calculations

STEP 2: ANALYZE THE DATA
Choose one of these approaches:

Option A (Recommended): Run the Analysis Script
- Save both resources to local files first
- Execute: node analyze-subscriptions.js transactions.csv
- The script will output accurate calculations and detected subscriptions
- Explain the results in human-readable format for the user

Option B: Manual Analysis
- Analyze the CSV data directly using your reasoning
- Look for patterns matching the criteria below

ANALYSIS CRITERIA:
A transaction is considered a recurring subscription if:
- Same merchant name appears multiple times
- Amounts are identical or very similar (within $0.50)
- Appears at regular intervals (monthly pattern: 25-35 days apart)
- At least 2 occurrences in the dataset

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
For each detected subscription, provide:
1. Merchant/Service Name
2. Monthly Cost (exact amount)
3. Number of Occurrences Found
4. Pattern Frequency (e.g., "Monthly on 2nd", "Monthly on 10th")
5. Total Amount Spent (occurrences × cost)
6. Annual Projection (monthly cost × 12)

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE:
Start with a summary of total monthly subscription costs, then list each subscription with details. End with actionable insights about spending patterns.
