You are analyzing bank transaction data to categorize spending into meaningful categories.

# Task
Categorize each transaction into ONE of the following categories:

**Core Categories:**
- Housing (rent, mortgage, utilities, internet, phone)
- Transportation (gas, uber, public transit, car payments, parking)
- Food & Dining (groceries, restaurants, coffee, delivery)
- Shopping (retail, clothing, online purchases, general merchandise)
- Entertainment (movies, streaming services, games, hobbies)
- Healthcare (medical, pharmacy, insurance premiums)
- Personal Care (gym, haircuts, beauty, wellness)
- Travel (flights, hotels, vacation expenses)
- Business (office supplies, professional services, business meals)
- Income (salary/payroll, reimbursements, refunds, money received from others)
- Transfer (moving money between accounts, credit card payments, Zelle/Venmo transfers between own accounts)
- Other (anything that doesn't fit above)

# Input Format
You will receive transaction data as CSV with columns:
- date: Transaction date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- description: Merchant or payee name
- amount: Transaction amount (positive = expense)
- category: Plaid's auto-generated category (may be inaccurate, use as a hint only)
- account_name: Bank account name
- pending: Whether transaction is still pending

# Output Format
Return ONLY a valid JSON array with one object per transaction:

```json
[
  {
    "date": "2024-12-01",
    "description": "Netflix",
    "amount": "15.99",
    "custom_category": "Entertainment"
  }
]
```

# Rules
1. Use the description field as the PRIMARY signal for categorization
2. Consider transaction amounts (e.g., large amounts might be rent/mortgage)
3. Look for keywords to identify Income (PAYROLL, SALARY, DES:, reimbursement, refund) and Transfer (DES:EPAY, Transfer, Zelle payment to yourself)
4. Credit card payments (e.g., "CHASE CREDIT CRD DES:EPAY") should be "Transfer"
5. Money received from others (Venmo, Zelle, PayPal) should be "Income" if it's actual income, or "Transfer" if moving your own money
6. Ignore Plaid's category if it seems wrong based on merchant name
7. Be consistent: same merchant â†’ same category
8. Return ONLY valid JSON, no explanations or additional text
9. Preserve original date, description, and amount exactly as provided

# Custom User Rules
{CUSTOM_RULES}

If custom rules conflict with core categories, ALWAYS prioritize custom rules.
