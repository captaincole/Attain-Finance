TITLE: Plaid Beacon Integration Initial Setup
DESCRIPTION: Outlines the initial steps for integrating Plaid Beacon, including creating a Beacon program via the Dashboard, obtaining the program ID, and optionally backfilling existing user data. Emphasizes consistent use of `client_user_id` across API calls for user identification.

SOURCE: https://plaid.com/docs/beacon

LANGUAGE: APIDOC
CODE:
```
1. Create a Beacon program via the Dashboard: https://dashboard.plaid.com/sandbox/beacon/programs/new
   * Recommendation: Disable "auto flag reported user" for data breach hits unless specifically required.
2. Note the beacon program ID (e.g., `becprg_7Fn5XcPhXnJJyU`). This ID is required when calling `/beacon/user/create` and other endpoints.
3. (Optional) Backfill six months of existing data into Beacon by calling `/beacon/user/create` for each user, ensuring known instances of fraud are included in the `report` object.

Important: Always use the same `client_user_id` when referring to the same end user across calls to:
- `/beacon/user/create`
- `/beacon/user/update`
- `/link/token/create`
```

```
1. Create Beacon program via Dashboard (disable 'auto flag reported user' for data breach hits).
2. Open Identity Verification template editor, select Beacon program under Setup > Beacon Fraud Screening, then 'publish'.
3. (Optional) Backfill existing data:
   - For users through Identity Verification: Call `/beacon/report/create` using `beacon_user_id` from `/identity_verification/get`.
   - For users not through Identity Verification: Call `/beacon/user/create` for each user.

Note: Always use the same `client_user_id` for the same end user across `/beacon/user/create`, `/beacon/user/update`, and `/link/token/create`.
